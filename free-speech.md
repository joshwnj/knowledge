> Well, once again they have proven me right," Yiannopoulos said

> Being "proven right" after lighting the fuse is central to Yiannopoulos's rhetorical MO. He riles his enemies into a frenzy with speeches like "How Feminism Hurts Women", or by declaring his birthday "World Patriarchy Day", and then sits back and gloats when the inevitable backlash comes.

## Q. Should milo censor himself, to avoid offending others?

Here's how I approach this question: rather than saying _"milo shouldn't say those things"_ or _"protestors shouldn't use violence"_, we can take a step back and consider motives.

TL;DR: measure someone by what you perceive as their motives, rather than by how closely they match a "good" or "bad" abstract ideal.

### Q. What kinds of things motivate people?

These are, in my opinion, the main ones:

- fear
- self-interest (money / status / honour)
- duty
- love

Here's my hypothesis: anything that does not have love at the foundation is destructive in the long run.

### Q. What do you think Milo's motive is?

- is there any evidence of love in his actions?
- are his actions constructive or destructive?

You can ask the same thing about the people smashing stuff and pepper-spraying.
