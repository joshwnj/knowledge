# fundamentalist

I have a theory: everyone is a fundamentalist.

Your fundamentals are your inner-most core values. In fact they go so deep that, until they are threatened, you often don't even identify what they are exactly.

Yet they nonetheless shape one's actions, and are the lens through which one sees the world and fits it into a narrative.

Being a "fundamentalist" is usually associated with being at best uptight, and at worst dangerous. But I'd like to suggest that it's neither good nor bad in itself - that is entirely determined by what one's fundamentals are.
