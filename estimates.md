# Estimates

Here's the idea: stop _estimating_ how long software will take to build. _Allocate_ time instead. It's not a new idea, I'm just thinking through it :)

It's sleight-of-hand in one sense. You still have to estimate how much time to allocate. But the vibe has totally changed now:

- when we estimate something, we're saying _"I think it will take this long"_. Then if it takes longer, we say _"Oh well, looks like I didn't account for everything in my estimate"_. Solution: get better at guessing!
- when we allocate time for something, we're saying _"This is how much time you've got to deliver"_. If it's going to take longer, we say _"Better figure out how to make this work"_. Solution: get better at reaching compromises and communicating.

It might sound too strict, like you're choosing the box first and then deciding what to put in it. But developers are actually very good at doing that! By saying "make it fit" you're actually granting them some creative licence. If corners have to be cut, there's the beginning of a conversation from which the whole team can benefit. Maybe time needs to be extended to avoid cutting necessary features. Or maybe the developers have come up with a creative way to build your product in a shorter time.
