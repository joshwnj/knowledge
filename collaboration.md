# collaboration

**Premise:** all collaboration happens within the context of a conversation.

Even at the times when we stop talking, put our headphones on and work away on something, it's because the conversation has reached the point where everyone is on the same page and we know how to collaborate.  And the work we do at this point will feed the next conversation.

Out of discussion come action points. Out of action come discussion points. It's the circle of life.

So if we want good collaboration, we need good conversation tools.

**Premise:** in-person conversation can only get so far.

The easiest way to have a conversation is to put people in a room. But the best conversations are those with the most contributors. You hit scaling problems even before you reach the biggest room, because of the limitation of sound waves as a medium. The best conversations have been carried on for thousands of years through written words.
