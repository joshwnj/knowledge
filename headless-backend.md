# [](#headless-backend)Headless Backend

idea: headless backend

-   create the data models and business logic etc, and then step through all functionality
-   at each step it asks you questions:
    -   _"has the user exceeded their quota?"_
    -   _"was there a payment error?"_
-   and the response can also contain new URLs to complete various follow-up actions

-   the goal is that we present a graph of possible next-steps and outcomes
