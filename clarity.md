# Clarity

What is the number 1 most important thing you need to be productive? Clarity.

One hour with a clear vision in your head is more valuable than a whole day of wandering around unable to grasp the bigger picture.

## Interruptions

Interruptions and distractions are a big clarity-killer. You can recover from one or two, but beyond that your brain won't focus because it will be always half-anticipating the next one.

If you're trying to focus and you know there's a possibility of being interrupted, it's often better to not even start.  Just do something else, something more mechanical that you can pick up and put down.

Then when you know you'll have 1 hour free from interruptions:

- close down all email, slack, phone
- put a sign on the door saying _"I'll be out at 11:30"_
- put a timer on the phone, and avoid responding to anything short of a house fire before the timer goes off.
- re-read the high level goals and recent journal entries as a way of picking up those loose threads.
