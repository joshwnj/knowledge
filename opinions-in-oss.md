# opinions in opensource

one of the things I've been learning over the last few years is the importantance of opinions in opensource. Especially as you move from lower-level libraries to higher-level applications.

I think this is one of the secrets of opensource:

- don't build "for everyone", build "for yourself"
- spend time crafting your opinions about how things should work, until they are strong opinions
- make your opinions very clear. put them in the readme
- then sometimes, others will see them and say _"hey, i can get behind those opinions"_. It's the seed from which a community grows.
