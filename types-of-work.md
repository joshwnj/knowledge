# types of work

In my day-to-day work I observe 4 main types of work, and I try to plan my day so that there will be elements of each, with a time of context-switch in between (even like a 5 minute walk is good).

## big-picture

- planning, brainstorming, creating proposals

## small-picture

- implementing & executing
- can still be exploratory work: you don't always know exactly what needs to be done at this point, but you're getting into the details of a single aspect of a plan.

## review

- taking stock of new information
- searching for patterns

## social

- following up people
- meetings
