# core values

Everybody has "core values".

These values are what you _optimise your life towards_, and they influence every decision you make, though often subconsciously. Most of the time I am privileged to live in a performance surplus, so optimisation is not even a question. But when the chips come down I'm forced to choose: what is more important to me? A or B?  These are the times you begin to see clearly what your core values are.

**Experiment:** you probably have an idea of what your core values are, as they are wrapped up in what you aspire to and call "best". Think about some decisions you made today, or recently. Do they align with the values you expected them to? If not, this may be a time to learn something new about yourself.
