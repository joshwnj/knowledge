# coding with kids

## scratch: Code with Anna and Elsa

<https://studio.code.org/s/frozen/stage/1/puzzle/1>

- started this with my daughter (6), and she is really loving it after the first few puzzles.
- there's some nice intro to geometry & angles, as well as thinking in patterns.
- i like how it works with experimental play (eg. "What happens if i change this?") as well as encouraging to run the simulation in your head, and then use the computer to confirm your expectations.

### summary

- I was helping my daughter at first, but after the first few I just let her experiment with it. When she got stuck, rather than telling her what to do, I gave her an idea of a different way to experiment (eg. "what if you change _that_ value?")
- by the end she was figuring out the solutions without any help from me at all, and was so excited and proud of the achievement.
