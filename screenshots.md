-   <https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/url-to-image/> does a good job of waiting until the page has loaded / redirected before taking the screenshot
-   doesn't give a way to set request headers or cookies, so adding that myself

-   [nightmare](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare) also looks good, need to compare.
    -   nice companion: <https://github.com/segmentio/daydream>
