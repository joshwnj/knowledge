# Team communication

Consider the progression here:

## what should I do next?

Asking what to do next is fine, but think about the extra burden this puts on team members. You're setting an expectation that they are responsible for your productivity.

## should I do {{thing}} next?

Better, because even though you're somewhat reliant on others for help, you're giving an indication that you have thought about it.

You've also potentially lowered the effort for your team members to respond.

## I'll start doing {{thing}} next because of {{reasons}}.
