# TIL

For those who keep a dev journal like I do, I'd like to introduce a new type of journal entry: the "TIL".

These can be really short posts that show one thing you learned while working on a project.

Sometimes it's something very specific to the project, like a significant requirement that you found while digging through some docs. Sometimes it's more general knowledge that you discovered or remembered along the way, like a debugging technique or handy bash trick.

## How to write a TIL

Start looking for those little "learning moments" in your day, and quickly jot down some notes in your journal. Remember, keep it quick & raw. If others read it and have questions, they can ask for more info.

Try to keep it down to a couple of sentances and maybe a code snippet or screenshot.

**Exercise:** try making a couple of TIL posts during your working day.

## Why do we often avoid this?

It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking _"I won't share that TIL, because everybody probably knows it already and then I will seem dumb! Or what if I'm wrong and there's actually a better way to do it??"_

As a wise commander once pointed out, _"It's a trap"_.

Just do it, and everyone will thank you later.

## Why should we do this?

Let me address those 2 fears:

- _**"everybody probably knows it already"**_: Who cares :) Maybe they do, but maybe they don't. Only someone very arrogant will think badly of you at this point. That's their problem, not yours.

- _**"what if I'm wrong and there's actually a better way to do it?"**_: Again, don't let this stop you. If somebody else knows a better way, this may be your golden opportunity to learn it! They might have been avoiding sharing this knowledge for the very same reason described above! This is your chance to break the cycle.

## Example

The other day I was reviewing pull requests on a github project, I and remembered a handy way to review them locally. I wrote it as a quick "TIL" entry, and since there's no sensitive businesss info there I also posted it to twitter: https://twitter.com/joshwnj/status/855215578042073088

In a couple of days it had 13 retweets and 9 likes. That's nothing groundbreaking, but if there's a handful of people that found it useful, it's totally worth the 2 minutes it took me to write.
