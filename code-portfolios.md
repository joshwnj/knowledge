# code portfolios

- actual code is less important than you might think. If you dump 1000 lines in front of a reviewer, they might skim it and miss the most important parts :) Keep code samples as small as you can, to highlight the best bits.

- pseudocode can often be more useful than real code. And this is also a helpful way of getting around NDAs, IP ownership, etc.  As long as you're not including any sensitive information.

- a portfolio should tell a story that not only illustrates your experience, but shows how you gained it. Eg:
  - here's how I started doing `<thing>`
  - then I learned `<technique>`
  - now it looks like `<improved thing>`
