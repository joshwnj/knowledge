- I still feel like there's an elegent solution trying to get out here...
- stuck on the interplay between `.props` and `.attr`
- maybe we can settle on a solution where there's no difference between `.props` and `.attr`, but we apply an intermediate layer to do the filtering

- ok so I'm defining the catch-22 as:
  - components need their output to be "a function" of their prop-sig
  - but we don't want all props in the prop-sig to become attributes element
  - it's tedious to manually whitelist attributes
  - it feels wasteful to filter from a whitelist of allowed html attributes

- possible solutions
  - intermediate filter layer
  - shortcut for creating elements
  
- the way react works well is:
  - each layer does a single meaningful transformation
  - every component is a function of its props
  
- design goals: 
  - keep things together that belong together
  - make it easy to do the right thing
