# flowtype covariance / contravariance

I came across this flowtype error in a react component:

```
Error: components/MyComponent.js:34
 34:     this.onChange = this.onChange.bind(this)
              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ property `onChange`. Covariant property `onChange` incompatible with contravariant use in
 34:     this.onChange = this.onChange.bind(this)
         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ assignment of property `onChange`
```

It's a pretty common practice to bind methods like this in the constructor when writing react component classes.

I'd like to understand better exactly what the flowtype error message is talking about. Possibly something to do with reassigning the value of `this.onChange`? 

In the meantime the solution is pretty easy. Add `onChange: Function` to the class:

```
class MyComponent extends PureComponent<Props> {
  onChange: Function
  
  constructor (props: Props) {
    super(props)
    
    this.onChange = this.onChange.bind(this)
  }

  // ...rest of class...
}
```

You could also use a more descriptive type than `Function` but this is an easy way to iterate.
