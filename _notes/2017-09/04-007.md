# drx

I'm starting to see that an important part of this is the inter-dependencies between component's props.

We could define dependencies like this:
 
```
const A = x({
  message: 'default value'
})

const B = x({
  children: A.message
})
```

We could also use a define a dependency on more than 1 prop:

```
const A = x({
  message: 'default value',
  shout: false
})

const B = x({
  children: x.from(
    A.message, A.shout,
    ({ message, shout }) => shout ? message.toUpperCase() : message
  )
})
```

When we pass in `A.message` or `A.shout`, we're not passing values but "prop reference" objects. `drx` can analyse all of these references at startup-time to decide which props `A` should use when rendering child `B`.
