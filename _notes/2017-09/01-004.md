# drx

- stuff is generally computed outside `DrxComponent` and then passed in
- find out whether it's actually more performant to do `shouldRender` checks inside (does it prevent rerender of other things?)

```
const Root = x.div()

const Image = Root.x.img()

const Text = Root.x.span()
```

```
<DrxComponent>
  <RenderIf ...>
    <Select ...>
      <div ... />
    </Select>
  </RenderIf>
</DrxComponent>
```
