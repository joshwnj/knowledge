# drx

at startup time, when `c.children` is called, we can find out what proprefs the children need.

but I wonder if we want do it here, because it might change later.

Maybe at render-time. When we render a child-component:

- what proprefs does the child need? (direct refs, x.from, x.when)
- walk down the tree, and collect any proprefs from descendents
  - we can cache this part so we only need to walk the tree once

When we call `getProps`, we're answering the question "what props does this component need to be rendered with", or "what is the prop signature of this component"?

To answer that we need to check what the children want.

## alternative

An alternative approach here would be:

- in component A's `render()` method, walk down the tree to find any children that depend solely on component A's props.
- render them, and pass them in as rendered children
