- at the moment I'm creating sub-components that accept the props of the parent component.
- would be better if the sub-components had little to no knowledge of the parent, and put the onus on the parent to map to the child

```
const Parent = x.div()
  .content(
    x(Child1).props({ ... }),
    x(Child2).props({ ... })
  )
  
```

- maybe add a `.select('prop1', 'prop2')` form
  - `.select('*')` or `.selectAll()`
  - or does it make more sense for "select all" to be the default?
