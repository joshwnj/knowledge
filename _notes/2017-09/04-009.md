# react components

There's 2 ways to think about pure components in react:

- A. takes some props as input, and returns some virtual dom
- B. takes some props as input, and returns a set of new props

I feel like there's a nice conceptual simplicity in the second approach. If we define the props and their dependencies, computer should be able to infer a lot about how to create the virtual dom without needing to specify everything by hand.
