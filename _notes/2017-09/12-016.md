need to change the logic a bit. At the moment we're saying:

- if the component is an element, render it diretly as an element, with all selected props
- automatically select props from the parent if any children have dependencies on a parent's props

combining these 2 together, we can end up with a lot of unsupported attributes on elements.

instead, we need to say:

- look at whether the component is an element, and whether it is supporting any child dependencies, to determine whether to render the element alone, or a wrapper component around it.
