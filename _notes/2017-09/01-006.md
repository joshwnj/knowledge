- decision: should props be opt-in or opt-out by default?
  - leaning towards opt-in...

- Q. what would it look like if we didn't try to combine wrappers with elements?

- innerProps are used on the element
  - if something is an innerProp, it will always be needed as an outerProp

- we never need an outerProp unless it's used by .style / .props / .content

- problem: when we set props with `.props({ ... })` it sticks for future renders...
  - perhaps most of the time we say `.props()` what we actually mean is `.defaultProps()` ?

- when we say `.props` we're informing the parent how to render us

- when is it that we actually need props on a wrapper that aren't on the element?
  - when we need render-logic (`.renderIf` or `.style`)
