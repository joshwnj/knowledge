# drx

one issue I've noticed: because I'm overwriting `DrxComponent.children` from a PropRef to a function, it can no longer be used as a propref. So there's no way to say "use the original children of the parent for the value of this prop".

Is that even a thing you would want to do? Probably at times it's a valid use case. So at very least we need to give a helpful error message, at the moment it will just blow up. 

Maybe the solution is to make _all_ prop refs functions (setters) that also have metadata attached.
