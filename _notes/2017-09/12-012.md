# drx notes

## 2 ways to think about pure components

A. takes some props as input, and returns a virtural dom

B. takes some props as input, and returns a set of new props

`drx` is focussing on the second option. Declaring the relationships and transformations to get from one component's props to another.

## wrapper with no type

- if there's no children, just render null.

## renderif

- `Drx.RenderIf` wrapper component
- props passed in match the proprefs passed in to `x.renderIf`

## cloning prop refs

- even when we make copies, still pass along the same prop refs (so we're not making copies of functions etc)

## context?

- or something along the same lines
- for rendertrees
- when you render the root component, there won't be any context available, so you know it's a root.
- add "root has rendered with these props"

## definitions and instances

- when you call the `x()` function, we push onto a module-space array of component definitions and record the index as an ID.

## screencast demo

- color picker
- css classes / variables to prevent unnecessary rewrites
