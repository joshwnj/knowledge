Originally I was thinking that when a component depends on a prop from an ancestor higher than the direct parent, we would walk up the render tree to find the value. I was going to use `context` to keep track of parents.

Problem I found with this is that since the direct parent is a PureComponent, it might not re-render even though the prop changed.

I think if we were going to do this, we'd need to render all children up front. Not sure yet how that will effect re-renders.
