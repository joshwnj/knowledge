# left and right

Q. What are some of the ways that both sides fail? These things aren't so obvious in the middle, but become more apparent as you get to the edges.

## right

- emphasis on objective moral code means that some are inevitably born into positions of power, while others into positions of seemingly inescapable vulnerability.
- the more confident we become in the idea of absolute "right and wrong" ways to live, the more we set ourselves up for hypocrisy.

## left

- the left avoids hypocrisy by avoiding the idea of an objective moral code.
- But this leads to absurdity. We recognise evil in the world, but who are we to judge "good" from "evil"? By what standard?
