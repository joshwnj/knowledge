# discipline

- there is "skill" and then there is "discipline"
- as with any habit-forming, consistency is greater than quantity. Everyone can start with _something_ and build upon that.
- just like in physical training there are things we can do to help people form that discipline. A clear guideline that's easy to follow, and someone who will check up on you, that you are accountable to.
- these 2 things (clear guideline & accountability) will also help us to avoid "the slump". As a project matures or deadlines encroach, disciplines can slip. Or a dev might spend 8 hours debugging something, which only equates to 1 line of code. Somebody needs to be there alongside them pushing through the tough patch. But the end result is growth.
