problem: often I have multiple things to cover with a person, but because of timezone difference I have to do it via text. I am mindful of overloading people and things being missed as a result. There's a limit to the number of questions you can ask in one go.

So I need to find a way to open (and continue) several ongoing topics / threads

## possible solutions

- private gists?
- self-hosted etherpad? (is this still a thing?)
