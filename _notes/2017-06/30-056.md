# tcomb: custom fail handler

By default, when a type validation fails `tcomb` throws a `TypeError`.  In local development it can be useful to override this behaviour and start the debugger instead. Then we can easily browse up the stack to identify where the data came from:

```js
const t = require('tcomb')

t.fail = function fail (message) {
  debugger
}
```
