# Requirements

## Record the facts

- one way to gather requirements is to make a list of "facts" about how the system works.
- these might also have accompanying notes to clarify edge cases
- then whenever developing a feature, writing a QA script, or reporting a bug, try to refer to as many of these facts as possible
- need a good way to search for them
- should make it really easy to add new facts, even if there is some overlap
- too confusing to try and describe the entire system in prose, but this way of describing the system is like pointalism: as we add more and more of these points, the whole picture begins to emerge
- still useful to categorise things into sections / screens

## Annotate screenshots

-  ather than having to manually name each thing when you describe it, we need to be able to say "this thing" and point to an area in an image file.
