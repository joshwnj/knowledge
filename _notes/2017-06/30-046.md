## Using github issues to discuss features

Often features are discussed in multiple places like slack, google docs, or in-person meetings. It's important to have a primary location where all of the info and relevant discussion points are stored.

Here's one way to do it using github issues:

- When you want to propose a new feature, create a github issue with a special "feature" label.
- discuss the feature and ask questions in github comments. Any out-of-band discussion can also be added or linked.
- when all questions are answered and requirements finalized, edit the top-level description of the issue to reflect the final version.

Using github issues has a couple of advantages:

- per-issue subscriptions, so you are notified of updates
- easy to embed images when needed (drag and drop files, or paste from clipboard)
- easy to create cross-reference links between the feature & bug reports or pull-requests
