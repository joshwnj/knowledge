# efficient process

One of the ways I know about improving efficiency is to batch operations. So if you have to make 10 sandwiches you don't make 1 sandwich then start on the next. You slice 20 pieces of bread, butter 20 pieces of bread, etc.

This leads to less context switching, and also highlights opportunities for automation or abstraction. Like what if there was such a thing as pre-sliced bread? That would be the best thing ever.
