# idea: headless backend

- create the data models and business logic etc, and then step through all functionality
- at each step it asks you questions:
  -   _"has the user exceeded their quota?"_
  -   _"was there a payment error?"_
- and the response can also contain new URLs to complete various follow-up actions
- the goal is that we present a graph of possible next-steps and outcomes
