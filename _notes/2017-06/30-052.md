# screenshots

- <https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/url-to-image/> does a good job of waiting until the page has loaded / redirected before taking the screenshot
- doesn't give a way to set request headers or cookies, so adding that myself

- [nightmare](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare) also looks good, need to compare.
  - nice companion: <https://github.com/segmentio/daydream>
