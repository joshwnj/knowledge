- "where your treasure is, there your heart will be also" ([matthew 6:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6&version=NIV))
- the things we most easily give our resources to are the things we treasure the most.
- if someone considers themselves a christian:
  - you are called to give first and then figure out the practicality (rather than giving out of leftovers, after securing your own comfort).
  - you are called to check your privilege: you didn't earn money or status with hard work, it was given to you.
