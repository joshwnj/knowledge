# Today VS Tomorrow

I can categorise my work between **today stuff** and **tomorrow stuff**. In other words:

- **today**: everyday management, admin, followups, checkins, etc. Small-picture details to keep things moving.
- **tomorrow**: planning, investigating new opportunities. Big-picture value.

Ideally I want to be spending the majority of my time in tomorrow-land. And that means finding ways to deal with the today-stuff so I'm not bogged down.

This is where "creating time" comes in. The time I can create is _time for tomorrow stuff_. Time is created by reducing today stuff:

- **do it more efficiently.** Can things be batched or automated?
- **do less.** Are these things really necessary? What is their value in relation to other things?
- **delegate.** Can someone else do it?
