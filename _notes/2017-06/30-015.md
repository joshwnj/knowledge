# what's the `version: '2'` bit I sometimes see at the top of a `docker-compose.yml`?

At first I was confused by this. Is "version 2" an upgrade, or a downgrade, from where I am now??

Answer: version 3 is the latest, and is the default if you don't specify a version. So don't worry about version 2.
