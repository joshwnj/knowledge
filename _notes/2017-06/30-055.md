**tl;dr** christmas tells us that:

- we have freedom from striving to live a good life
- imperfect people can be in a love relationship with a perfect god, without fear
- love matters, it's not just an accident

## notes

- every other religion is founded by a prophet or wise person who said _"this is the way"_. Christianity is the only one founded by someone who said "I _am_ the way".
  - Christ doesn't speak the words of God, he _is_ the word of God.
  - he didn't come and say "here's what you need to do", he said "I've come to do for you what you could never do for yourself"
  - he didn't come to say "here's how to live a good life", he said "I _am_ the eternal life".

- secular view is: _"doctrine doesn't matter, what matters is that you live a good life"_.
  - this is a doctrine itself: a religion where your "salvation" comes from your own good works.
  - this kind of religion can have no true humility (because if you are good enough, you earned it) and no true peace (because there is no guarantee that your good outweighs your bad).

- you can't look directly at the sun, it will destroy your eyes. If you want to see the full awesomeness of the sun, you need to look through a filter.
  - the meaning of Christmas is that we have a way to see God and know him personally. Jesus is the way that imperfect people can come near to a perfect God, without being burned up.

- christmas is historical evidence that love really matters
  - if this world is all that there is, we came from nothing and will end as nothing
  - [Francis Crick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Crick) "The Astonishing Universe": "everything about you, your entire concept of identity, is no more than nerves and chemical responses"
  - christmas gives us a different narrative. It tells us that love is an eternal and foundational element of the universe. Love was there even before time began, and is the reason for everything that followed.

- [Yuri Gagarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin) was the first cosmonaut to orbit the earth, and russia issued a statement: "we have been to heaven and there was no god there"
  - [C.S. Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis): "hamlet won't find shakespeare in the rafters above the stage". The only way hamlet can know anything about shakespeare is if the author wrote himself in to the story.

- we feel intrinsically that love is timeless. We say "I'll love you forever" even though this defies the way we think about the world.
