# jest

- don't `import jest`. Otherwise you get weird stuff like `jest.fn()` not working. The `jest` object is injected as a global when you run the `jest` cli.

- if you're using `afterAll`, make sure any tests with promises return the promise (to ensure `afterAll` waits for things to finish)

- when doing integration tests, make sure you `--runInBand` (because otherwise changes to db will happen in an unpredictable order)

- if you're used to using `tape`, like me, beware that `test('...', (t) => { ... })` will hang because the first arg is a callback to signify done-ness: https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/asynchronous.html#content
