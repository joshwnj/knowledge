# trying virtual-audio-graph

- seems to be a bug in the example, creating multiple AudioContext's
- fixed when I just let `ag` create its own

- couple of times I misspelled `frequency` as `freqency`. And my code failed silently. Would be good to warn about unexpected params

- need to make sure we don't mutate the `graph` when calling `ag.update()` subsequent times

```
ag.update(Object.assign({}, graph, { lfo: ha.osc('mod', { frequency: 1 }) }))
```
