# spectacle

[source](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle)

- using boilerplate, seems like a great way to get started

- I wonder if there's a way to hook into forward / backward events, so I could for example add a css class instead of the usual `<Appear>` behaviour

## styling

I'm finding the builtin styling approach a bit confusing, but starting to see the rationale behind it:

designed to be adaptive: https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/issues/172

> Your base content area is 1000px x 700px. If you go below that, in width or height, it begins to scale the content using css transforms. 

The problem is that this appears to be sometimes happening unintentionally, which results in my base font sizes jumping around.

I'm trying out adding `.spectacle-slide { max-height: 700px }` and see if I get more control that way. 

So far so good

```
cmz('spectacle-slide', `
  max-height: 700px
`).toString()
```

## thoughts

- I like a lot of the things that it does, but I can't help feeling it's doing a lot more than what I want...
