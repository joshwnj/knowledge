# declarative react

I'm noticing that my pattern of using react is moving towards a more declarative style.

One nice thing about declarative react is you don't need to think as much about where a certain thing goes. Eg. _"this part goes inside the `render` function, that part goes outside"_. In a declarative approach the computer figures that stuff out.

Consider these 2 alternatives for rendering a component with text and an optional image. The first is kind a "semi-declarative" style that we see a lot in react:

```js
function render (props) {
  return <div>
    { props.imageUrl ? <img src={props.imageUrl} /> : null }
    <span>{ props.text }</span>
  </div>
}
```

We could make this even more declarative by making an `Image` component that knows it only displays when there is an imageUrl:

```js
const Image = img()
  .renderIf('imageUrl')
  .props({ imageUrl: 'src' })
  
function render (props) {
  return <div>
    <Image {...props} />
    <span>{ props.text }</span>
  </div>
}
```

What if we took that one step further, so that we define a structure of components that know how to behave / map based on props?

```js
const Image = img()
  .renderIf('imageUrl')
  .props({ imageUrl: 'src' })
 
const Text = span()
  .content(p => p.text)

const Root = div()
  .content(
    Image,
    Text
  )

function render (props) {
  return Root(props)
}
```

hey let's even just collapse that last bit:

```
const render = Root
```
