Say you have a file called `env/dev`, with environment vars in it like this:

```
# here is a comment
PORT=8000

# here is another comment
SECRET=password123
```

Then you can populate the environment with `. env/dev` (or `source env/dev`).

But sometimes this will not be sufficient. For example, when you set env vars this way they are not available within a `node` program. Eg.

```
> . env/dev
> node -e 'console.log(process.env.SECRET)'
undefined
```

In this case we have to `export` those vars. You can do it like this:

```
export $(cat env/dev)
```

But that will break if there are any comments in the file. We can filter out the comment-lines like this:

```
export $(cat env/dev | grep -v ^#)
```

Turns out you don't even need the `cat`:

```
export $(grep -v ^# env/dev)
```
