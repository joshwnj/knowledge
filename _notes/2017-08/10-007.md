I found that the [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) setup in my `~/.bash_profile` was causing quite a big slowdown, whenver I opened a new terminal. 

Not exactly sure what is slow yet. Best quick fix I've seen is described in <https://github.com/creationix/nvm/issues/1277#issuecomment-318915266>. In short:

- create a symlink that points to the version of node you want to be your default:

```
cd ~/.nvm/versions/node/
ln -s v8.3.0 global
```

- edit your `~/.bash_profile` to use the symlink, and defer running `nvm.sh` until you actually need to use the `nvm` command:

```
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
export PATH=$NVM_DIR/versions/node/global/bin:$PATH
export MANPATH=$NVM_DIR/versions/node/global/share/man:$MANPATH

nvm() {
  [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
  nvm "${@}"
}
```
