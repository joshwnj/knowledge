I found that the [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) setup in my `~/.bash_profile` was causing quite a big slowdown, whenver I opened a new terminal. 

Not sure what is slow yet, but quick fix was to remove the auto setup, and just run the setup when I need it: 

```
alias nvm-load=". $NVM_DIR/nvm.sh && . $NVM_DIR/bash_completion"
```
