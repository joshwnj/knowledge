## Notes

The belief that one's ethnicity is in some way superior or nobler than another is not merely rude, unkind or ignorant. It is evil and ugly to the deepest degree.

- in a few points in american history, a theology was formulated specifically to accomodate the racial caste system. 
  - So even in the midst of the civil rights movement in the 50s and 60s, many church leaders found themselves completely theologically ill-equipped to see their own errors.

- many americans are not so much "white-supremists" as "american-supremists". They consider america to be "God's chosen nation".

- we need to be united by something stronger than nationality or ethnicity if we are ever to escape their bind.
