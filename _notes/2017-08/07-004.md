# learning about electron & chrome remote debugger

- trying to use `chrome-remote-interface` to dynamically update js source at runtime, following example here: https://github.com/cabul/electron-hot/blob/master/lib/index.js

- I can see the script ID, it appears to be the same each time I run (although I do expect it will change at some point in future)

- calling `client.Debugger.setScriptSource`
  - seems to be firing the error callback with an arg of `true`
  - ahh ok looks like `scriptId` needs to be a string, not an int

- found this example here too: https://gist.github.com/paulirish/920a260cadfe05e8388c

- `getScriptSource` is working, not seeing any change after calling `setScriptSource` though

- but if I call `getScriptSource` a second time, I do see the new source. So it was set, it just didn't do anything in the browser window

- one big roadblock here: as soon as I open the debugger console in the electron BrowserWindow, my remote debugger websocket requests all fail
  - looks like someone else found this too: https://gitter.im/mattdesl/wtch?at=54dceedde0d4eb7f0a49b6c1

- at some point I'll try to make a small demo showing this stuff.

- there seems to be some aggressive caching of `<script>` js files when loaded via a local node http server...
  - adding `?v=...` busts the cache
