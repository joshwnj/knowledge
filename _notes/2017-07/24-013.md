# functions that know how to do one thing

I came across some code like this today:

```js
  handleSubmit (formData) {
    const { actions, doc } = this.props
    actions.save({
      ...formData,
      someField: parseInt(formData.someField, 10)
    }, doc)
  }
```

and while it's not terrible, it stands out that this function is doing more than it should. It knows how to:

1. normalize the form data (convert `someField` to an int)
1. call the `save` action

If we rewrite those two things as separate functions:

```js
  normalizeFormData (data) {
    return {
      ...data,
      someField: parseInt(data.someField, 10)
    }
  }

  handleSubmit (formData) {
    const { actions, doc } = this.props
    actions.save(this.normalizeFormData(formData), doc)
  }
```

Now it reads more clearly, and we have an easy place to unit-test some edge cases in the `normalizeFormData` pure function.

We've also gained some useful encapsulation. The `handleSubmit` function only needs to know about forwarding the data to the right place. All of the knowledge of the nature of that data is contained in the `normalizeFormData` function.
