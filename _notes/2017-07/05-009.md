[Francis Chan: what is up with the number 666?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLVAQ3EsrjI)

- Revelation 13 has captured the imagination of the world.
- the church is full of people who intellectually agree with what is said, but have never made an ongoing personal commitment to follow Jesus.
- symbols pointing back to ancient empires, and of an empire to come which is stronger than all of them combined.
- Q. what would it take for the whole world to be astonished, to the degree that people follow?
- this all-powerful world leader will command war against followers of Jesus.
- "had horns like a lamb, but spoke like a dragon". Looks like Jesus on the outside, but they speak the words of the devil.
- Q. when everyone else in the world is doing things a certain way, and you'll be killed if you don't, will you still then choose your actions rationally, based on what you know to be true?
