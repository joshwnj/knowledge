# testing reducers in a react app

I worked on a project in 2015 which involved a fairly complex frontend built in react. We wanted to be able to move quickly and implement new features without breaking old ones, so it would be important to have tests in place that could tell us that all of the old features were still working correctly.

What we found was that a very good place for unit tests in a react app is in the reducers. In a well-architected react frontend using redux, all of the business logic should be in the reducers, rather than in the components. So there's some good isolation there and it's easy to write unit tests that:

- set up a certain state
- simulate an action with certain arguments
- compare the final state after the reducer has run, and assert that it is as expected.

These tests were also very fast to execute, meaning we could easily run them often. With this in place we could get some continual feedback about any regressions introduced by new behaviour.

An example, in pseudocode:

- we have a "activity feed" component that should display the last 3 items.
- If there are 3 items in the list, and 1 more is added, it should still display 3 items (with the 4th item being bumped off the end of the visible list)

Our unit test looks like this:

```
import activityFeedReducer

setup initial state with 3 items in the feed: [C, B, A]
trigger action on activityFeedReducer: (ADD_ITEM, D)
assert state shows the new item, and still only 3: [D, C, B]
```
