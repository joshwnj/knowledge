# css-modulesify windows bug

- taking a look at this issue: https://github.com/css-modules/css-modulesify/issues/74
- the problem (or at least part of it) is that we're using `newPath[0] !== '/'` to tell if a path is absolute, but this is a false assumption on windows (as pointed out here https://github.com/css-modules/css-modulesify/issues/74#issuecomment-193521440)
- WIP branch: `fix-windows-abs-path` using the `path-is-absolute` package
- running `npm test` shows a failing test... output is correct, but order is different.
  - doing a clean install on master to track it down.
  - it's the upgrade to `css-modules-loader-core` behind it. Downgrading to 1.0.0 sees tests passing again
  - weird: upgraded back to 1.1.0 but now the bug is gone. maybe a phantom bug caused by a version mismatch
- PR: https://github.com/css-modules/css-modulesify/pull/117
