# Q. how to get the most out of docker build cache?

Thoughts:

- each line in the Dockerfile can be considered a cache-layer. If something changes and causes a layer to require rebuild, all following layers need a rebuild too.

- structure the file so that more-expensive-and-less-likely-to-change things are as close to the top of the file as possible.

- think about scenarios where things do change, and look at which expensive layers are invalidated.

- say we have 2 costly (time-consuming) layers, A and B.
  - in scenario 1, only A needs to be rebuilt
  - in scenario 2, only B needs to be rebuilt

- the problem here is that no matter which way you order it, you always end up doing some unnecessary rebuilding. (check: is this assumption correct?!)

- it might be possible in this situation to improve by splitting A and B into 2 separate Dockerfiles
