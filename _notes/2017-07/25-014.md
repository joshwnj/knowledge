- "open and closed"
- creativity thrives when we are "open" and playful, not stressed and time-constrained

- alfred hitchcock mistrusted working under pressure: "we're pressing, we're working too hard"
  - co-writer: when we came to a blocker, hitchcock would suddenly stop and tell a story that was almost completely unrelated. He did this deliberately!

- switching between "open" and "closed" is a way to be both creative & productive, for optimal efficiency
  - open: play, experiment, go on tangents
  - closed: focus on 1 thing
  - open: review how that went, look at the big picture
  - closed: refine and refocus

- the problem is, we all too often get stuck in the closed mode. Creativity is not possible in the closed mode

- a laugh happens when 2 ideas are connected in a new way, that generates some unexpected meaning or significance
  - computers can generate billions of possible connections and juxtapositions, but they will not be able to tell which ones "smell interesting" (intuition)
