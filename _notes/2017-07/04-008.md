# portfolio self-critique

Here are a couple I wrote awhile back:

- [Testing reducers](04-004.md)
- [Agile methodology](04-005.md)

To give more context on what I look for in a portfolio piece, the big difference between these 2 is that the "testing reducers" one gives a specific example from a project I worked on, whereas the "agile" one only gives a hypothetical example.

This is what I mean when I talk about portfolio pieces that connect knowledge with experience. he more specific detail you can add about solving a real problem, the stronger it speaks of your experience.
