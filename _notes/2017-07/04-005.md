# agile methodology

I've worked in a few teams that followed "agile" or "scrum" processes, and I completed scrum-master certification in 2010. I think there are a lot of good ideas there, but it seems that every team I've been in has a slightly different way of doing things :) And when I talk to other people in other companies, this seems to be a common experience.

One of the main takeaway principles that has helped me in the past is to have a strong focus on iterative prototyping. Rather than approaching a software problem and thinking "we've got the requirements, let's build it", I find it very helpful to find some aspect of the requirements to prototype. By this I mean: something that can be quickly built, to give interactive feedback about one or 2 individual aspects of the requirements.

For example, if the app has a form with a file-upload element, I might focus on building a prototype of *just* the file upload, before building the rest of the form.  Since this involves a few more moving-parts than the rest, if we build this bit first we can gain some more insight, which may affect our decision of what components to use for the rest of the form.

I've also worked in teams before where we have done the whole "planning poker", sprints, and backlog grooming sessions too. I'm not certain how dogmatic I would be about it, if I were the project manager. But I think there's a lot of value to the concepts behind it, and can see the value it can bring to a team.
