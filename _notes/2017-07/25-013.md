# gwen

Trying it out:

- installed latest binary following these instructions: https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/wiki/Installation
- installed geckodriver: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/tag/v0.18.0
- configured gwen to use it: https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web/wiki/Runtime-Settings
- ran the example:

```
./gwen -b features/todo/tables/TodoTable.feature
```

seems to work well
