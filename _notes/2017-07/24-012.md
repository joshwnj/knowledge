webaudio pain points

- creating a source, and then multiple filters / gains / etc.
  - you have to create each one in turn, and then connect them all together. And then elsewhere in code you have to remember which one was the last, so you can connect to the ac destination
  - would be easier if you could just create-and-connect in one operation
  - could also have a convention of `volumeIn` and `volumeOut` gains at either end of the pipe. Could be useful, could be wasteful, not sure yet.
