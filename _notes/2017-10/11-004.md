# categories of docs

I'm doing a big review / cleanup / refactor of all documentation for one of our projects today, and noticing some distinct categories:

- **Product**: info about the product itself, and rationale behind our approach
- **Process**: how we work together as a team
- **Code**: specific implementation details
- **Dev Environment**: Tools & Tips that can improve team productivity
